# textedit
This is my exploration of a terminal-like user interaction in a browser.
I am intentionally _reinventing the wheel_ here, and I don't recommend using this code as a library in your project:
there are dozens of full featured libraries that cover this functionality.
This code is just a bare minimum implementation, hopefully easy to read and to adapt to your needs.
The core logic, and soon the rest, is written in functional, immutable style.
Any comment is welcome.
